## Setup

Unfortunately, the Windows version of Python does not support the required `curses` library by default. If you are on Windows, you will need to install windows-curses to do so simply do the following:

- run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the command line inside the directory OR
- Just run `pip install windows-curses`
